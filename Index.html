    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <body> I am finishing up my Senior year at Eastern where I am studying VCD and minoring in Art. I have four brothers, one sister, one sister-in-law and then my two parents. I love spending time with my family and friends, being outdoors and designing of any kind. I’m interning right now at my parents design-build company in Spokane and am very excited to get out into the “real world,” come June! </body>
