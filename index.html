		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am finishing up my Senior year at Eastern where I am studying VCD and minoring in Art. I have four brothers, one sister, one sister-in-law and then my two parents. I love spending time with my family and friends, being outdoors and designing of any
		kind. I’m interning right now at my parents design-build company in Spokane and am very excited to get out into the “real world,” come June!</p>

			<p>I. love. this. movie. It's hilarious. It talks about real life struggles people go through but also puts a creative and funny spin on what it's like to be a maid of honor or bridesmaid in one of your friends wedding. It is ya girls top pick.</p>

		<p>Lalaland has quickly become one of my favorite movies this year. I love it because it's so whimsical, unlike any other movie and isn't as predictable as most chick-flicks. 10/10 would recommend. </p>

		<p>Elf is one of my favorite movies because it's just a classic. I love Will Farrell, funny things and Christmas! What more could you want in a movie?!</p>

		<h2>Favorite Book</h2>
		<p><img src="http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1335237698l/13497505.jpg" class="lovedoes"></p>
		<p> I love this book because it reminds me of some really fond memories at  summer camp. That's the first place I read it and it reminds me of sitting on the porch in the summer sun, reading Bob Goff's funny and insightful stories.</p>
